# Flarum for Composer Auto Installers
This is basically just a setup file so that Flarum can be installed on servers that can auto install composer projects, such as Hostinger.

# How to use:
From your Hostinger cPanel, scroll to the bottom until you see the git option.
Within that option follow these instructions:
Repository Address: https://github.com/redlockrepublic/flarum-hostinger.git
Branch: master
Install path: Whatever you like, make sure the directory is empty.
Click Create
Once the little plus icon has appeared, click it and then click Deploy.
Once done, you should be able to continue the installation from the setup address.
